# Import archives

The `import-archives` script helps rebuilding a cache from previous posts. It reads export files from Twitter, Mastodon and Bluesky and updates Touitomamout cache accordingly.

## Usage

Run the script with `ts-node` and provide the paths to your archive files when prompted:

```bash
npx ts-node src/tools/import-archives.ts
```

The script will ask for the following locations:

- **tweets.js** and optional **note-tweet.js** from the Twitter archive
- **outbox.json** from the Mastodon export
- the folder that contains Bluesky post files

## Example

```text
Path to tweets.js: /exports/twitter/data/tweets.js
Path to note-tweet.js (optional, press enter to skip):
Path to Mastodon outbox.json: /exports/mastodon/outbox.json
Path to Bluesky export folder: /exports/bluesky/posts
```

After parsing the files, the cache is updated with the discovered posts.
